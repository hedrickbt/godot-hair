Goal:
Create a hair scene - this will be our treasure!

1. Add a scene 
2. Add a node: Area2D / hair
	a. Add a child node: Sprite / sprite
	b. Attach the art/hair_test_1.png to the sprite.Texture via Drag-N-Drop
3. Save the scene as: hair.tscn ( ctrl+s )
4. Add a CollisionShape2D node as a child of hair - on the bottom of the list.  Name it: collision
	a. Use the shape property to create a new RectangleShape2D
	b. Be sure to only grab the two midpoint handles for resizing.
5. Save ( ctrl+s )
6. You can select both items (sprite/collision) if you want, move them to the middle of the scene and play
