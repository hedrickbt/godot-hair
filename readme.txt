Ideas to go
1. Add twitter icon that moves around haphazardly - take time away or reduce score when it hits you
2. Add a pick up - blow dryer that can collect hair via space bar
	a. Drier sound effect
	b. Will need a ray to detect if it is close enough for a hits
	c. Get more points when collected this way due to time it may take and possible miss
3. Have the last hair picked up go on his head
4. Add a couple of more hair styles with different point values
5. Wall pieces can show up that block access and blow dryer
6. Add a clock of some sort - picking it up extends the time
7. The new pick ups - blow dryer, clock, etc, should show up randomly starting at a specific 
level and then going forward
